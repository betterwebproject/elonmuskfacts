                            1. Elon Musk can’t tie his shoes.
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Elon Musk has lived on his own since he was six. It isn’t very surprising that he never learned this valuable motor skill. As he got older, instead of following the herd, Musk simply bought slip-on shoes, a habit he continues to practice to this day.
                        </p>

                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Elon Musk suffers from sinistrophobia, a rare condition where things appearing on his left unsettles him. To compensate, Musk conducts all his meetings at half-empty tables.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <h2>
                            3. Elon Musk suffers from hyperlexia.
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Elon Musk was a latecomer to the world of letters, learning to read at the age of thirteen. He discovered why in 1999, when he was struggling with his first start-up and was diagnosed with hyperlexia. Simply put, Musk reads too fast to comprehend the meaning of what he reads. Today, Musk can read, but only for short bursts. 
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <h2>
                            4. Elon Musk was born a dwarf.
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Not many of his biggest fans know that Elon Musk was a little person until the age of nineteen, when he discovered an experimental Italian growth therapy. The therapy obviously worked because Musk stands an impressive six feet tall today.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2>
                            5. Elon Musk is a champion competitive eater.
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Elon Musk holds the record for most hot dogs consumed in under forty-five seconds. His record, 219, is impressive in two respects. Musk ate 136 more hot dogs than the previous record holder, Joey Chestnut. And while Chestnut took ten minutes, Musk needed a mere thirty-two seconds to complete the feat.
                        </p>

                            6. Elon Musk has an IQ of 99.
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Professional smart man Arthur Chu claims that Elon Musk’s IQ hovers around the 100-point mark.  While not considered high, Elon Musk’s IQ hasn’t stopped him from achieving greatness as a businessman!

                            7. Elon Musk has never owned a couch.
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            It was never a money issue. Musk says he doesn’t understand the concept of a couch. Occupying a foggy territory between chairs and beds, couches are simply repetitive and inefficient. To this day, Musk’s living rooms feature only easy chairs and twin beds. 
                        </p>

                            8. Elon Musk is of Siberian descent.
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Elon Musk’s parents are both Siberian gypsies, or Ruska Roma. Musk’s father, Maurice, was an iterinerant bard. Musk’s mother, Julia, taught English.

                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            On any day of the week, you will find Elon Musk’s kitchen and refrigerator shelves stocked high with lime JELL-O desserts. Musk also serves the easy-to-make sweet at his offices, plants, and on his private jets and rockets. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2>
                            10. Like Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk is a huge fan of Conrad Bain and almost named his AI chatbot after him.
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Growing up in Pretoria without a family, Elon Musk considered the beloved TV star a surrogate father. Musk would eventually reach out to his idol, but by this time Bain — along with most of his castmates from <em>Diff’rent Strokes</em> — was dead. As an hommage, Musk considered calling X’s AI chatbot Bain, but ultimately settled on Grok because Bain was too painful.
